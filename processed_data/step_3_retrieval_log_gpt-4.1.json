The subscribing (Re)Insurers are not responsible for the subscription of any co-subscribing (Re)Insurer who for any reason does not satisfy all or part of its obligations.\n\n**In respect of Other Insurers:**\n\n**(RE)INSURERS LIABILITY CLAUSE (LMA 3333)**\n\n**(Re)insurer\u2019s liability several not joint**\n\nThe liability of a (re)insurer under this contract is several and not joint with other (re)insurers party to this contract. A (re)insurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has\n\nunderwritten. A (re)insurer is not jointly liable for the proportion of liability underwritten by any other (re)insurer. Nor is a (re)insurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract.\n\nThe proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by a (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp. This is subject always to the provision concerning \u201csigning\u201d below.\n\nIn the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is a (re)insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members\n\nof the syndicate taken together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other members. A member is liable only for that member\u2019s proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member\u2019s proportion. Nor is any member\n\notherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract. The business address of each member is Lloyd\u2019s, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The identity of each member of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd\u2019s, at the above address.\n\n**Proportion of liability**\n\nUnless there is \u201csigning\u201d (see below), the proportion of liability under this contract\nunderwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its \u201cwritten line\u201d.\n\nWhere this contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted\n(\u201csigned\u201d). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this contract to show the definitive proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). A definitive proportion (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate taken together) is referred to as a \u201csigned line\u201d. The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred.\n\nAlthough reference is made at various points in this clause to \u201cthis contract\u201d in the singular, where the circumstances so require this should be read as a reference to contracts in the plural.\n\n\\\\hyperion.hyperiongrp.com\\fileshare\\RKHS_Redirection$\\mauro.caracciolo\\Documents\\Slips 2023\\Brit\\Adventist Health System\\Adventist Health - FN2402512 Primary.docx\nUMR: B0180FN2402512 **ORDER**\n\n**HEREON:** 100.000% of 100.000%\n\n**BASIS OF**\n**WRITTEN**\n**LINES:** Percentage of Whole.\n\n**SIGNING**\n**PROVISIONS: Without Disproportionate Signing**\n\nIn the event that the written lines hereon exceed 100% of the order, any lines written \u201cto stand\u201d will be allocated in full.
