The subscribing (Re)Insurers are not responsible for the subscription of any co-subscribing (Re)Insurer who for any reason does not satisfy all or part of its obligations.\n\n**In respect of Other Insurers:**\n\n**(RE)INSURERS LIABILITY CLAUSE (LMA 3333)**\n\n**(Re)insurer\u2019s liability several not joint**\n\nThe liability of a (re)insurer under this contract is several and not joint with other (re)insurers party to this contract. A (re)insurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has\n\nunderwritten. A (re)insurer is not jointly liable for the proportion of liability underwritten by any other (re)insurer. Nor is a (re)insurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract.\n\nThe proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by a (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp. This is subject always to the provision concerning \u201csigning\u201d below.\n\nIn the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is a (re)insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members\n\nof the syndicate taken together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other members. A member is liable only for that member\u2019s proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member\u2019s proportion. Nor is any member\n\notherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract. The business address of each member is Lloyd\u2019s, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The identity of each member of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd\u2019s, at the above address.\n\n**Proportion of liability**\n\nUnless there is \u201csigning\u201d (see below), the proportion of liability under this contract\nunderwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its \u201cwritten line\u201d.\n\nWhere this contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted\n(\u201csigned\u201d). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this contract to show the definitive proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). A definitive proportion (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate taken together) is referred to as a \u201csigned line\u201d. The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred.\n\nAlthough reference is made at various points in this clause to \u201cthis contract\u201d in the singular, where the circumstances so require this should be read as a reference to contracts in the plural.\n\n\\\\hyperion.hyperiongrp.com\\fileshare\\RKHS_Redirection$\\mauro.caracciolo\\Documents\\Slips 2023\\Brit\\Adventist Health System\\Adventist Health - FN2402512 Primary.docx\nUMR: B0180FN2402512 **ORDER**\n\n**HEREON:** 100.000% of 100.000%\n\n**BASIS OF**\n**WRITTEN**\n**LINES:** Percentage of Whole.\n\n**SIGNING**\n**PROVISIONS: Without Disproportionate Signing**\n\nIn the event that the written lines hereon exceed 100% of the order, any lines written \u201cto stand\u201d will be allocated in full.

For the purpose of this Insuring Agreement, a \u201cpotential **claim**\u201d shall be considered to be first discovered at the time that a **responsible person** first becomes aware of sufficient information that would lead a reasonable person to conclude a **claim** is reasonably likely to be made.\n\n\n==== SECTION adventis.pdf016 END ====\n\n==== SECTION ID: adventis.pdf034 ====\nCancellation by You\n**XIX.

It is further agreed that service of process in such suit may be made upon our representative, designated in Item 14 (Service of Suit) of the Declarations, and that in any suit instituted against any one of them upon this contract; we will abide by the final decision of such court, or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal.\n\nB. **Our** representative designated in Item 14 of the Declarations is authorized and directed to accept service of process on **our** behalf in any such suit and/or upon **your** request to give a written undertaking to **you** that they will enter a general appearance upon **our** behalf in the event such a suit shall be instituted.\n\nC.

You must follow the guidelines below:\n\n1. Follow exactly the extraction instructions defined in the `Line item instruction` field within **LINE ITEM DEFINITION**\n2. Go through each section in the **POLICY DOCUMENT** throughly and check whether it contains definitions or phrases related to the extraction item, list ALL the evidence that supports your reasoning for the extraction task.\n3. Refer to **POLICY METADATA** for policy-level information and the coverage limits.\n4. (IMPORTANT) In insurance policies, endorsement can modify earlier definitions, if there exists endorsement that modifies the parameters of this extraction item, list ALL the evidence and your reasoning how this endorsement affects the extraction item.\n5. (IMPORTANT) There is NO DEFAULT VALUE for the line item parameters. If you cannot find the values for the parameters, you must leave the parameters as null and DO NOT ASSUME ANY VALUES.\n\n## OUTPUT\nOnce you have all the information, call `extract` tool to output result."
